    "# Virtual Bean Machine (VBM)\n",
    "\n",
    "The __Bean Machine__, also known as __Galton Board__, has been popularised by Francis Galton. Typically a wooden board with a reservoir of beans (or marbles) on the top and a number of bins at the bottom. In-between are several rows of pins. \n",
    "\n",
    "As beans fall down the board, they hit pins, and end up in one of the bins at the board\\'s bottom. Once many beans have gone through the machine, a distribution emerges that resembles the normal distribution (in fact, it is the binomial distribution). \n",
    "\n",
    "At the core of the Bean Machine is __a simple random process__: a bean hitting a pin. When this happens, it is equally likely that the bean goes left or right (50% each). Adding another row of pins to the Galton Board adds another iteration of this random process, where the bean again goes either left or right. The outcome of this process, and of previous iterations, determines where the bean lands on the bottom of the board.  "

    "__Distribution produced by the VBM__ From the histogram (at the bottom of the animation) it is obvious that a bean is likely to end up in a bin that is just below the bean\\'s starting point on its way down the board, but there is also some variability around the distribution\\'s center. It is also obvious that the resulting distribution depends on the number of pin rows. If there are only a few rows of pins, the bins will be wider and there will be fewer bins. This is because the range of theoretically possible scores is smaller when there are fewer iterations of the random process. \n",
    "\n",
    "Binning is the main reason why the resulting __binomial distribution__ is discrete (as the output states of the VBM are finite). For example, with two rows of pins there are three bins, and thus, there are only three possible outcomes of running a bean through the machine: The bean could end up in the bin on the left, in the center, or on the right - but nothing in-between. In contrast, the __normal distribution__ is a continuous distribution with an infinite number of theoretically possible variable scores. It is possible to approximate this continuous normal distribution with a VBM that has many rows of pins (and many beans). \n",
    "\n",
    "__Another way to think of the Bean Machine__ Statistically it makes no difference whether you run a Bean Machine with P rows of pins or if you flip a __fair coin__ P times. The distribution is the same. Also, the range of possible scores is the same. For example, if we write down 0 for heads and 1 for tails, the mean outcome of flipping a coin 10 times would be 0.5. Analogously, if you used a Bean Machine with 10 rows of pins and coded a bean going left as 0 and right as 1, respectively, the mean score would again be 0.5 \n"

    "__Boundaries__ The Bean Machine is not exactly a pinball machine. It does normally not happen that beans bounce off the (virtual) walls on the left or right of the board, so these boundaries do not limit the distribution by \"interfering\" with the random process. Rather, they mark the range of theoretically possible outcomes for P iterations of the random process. As there are X pins in the X-th row of the VBM, the range of theoretically possible scores is equal to the number of pin rows P + 1. Thus, a VBM with 10 rows of pins has 11 bins (and can produce 11 outcomes for each bean that it processes).\n",
    "\n",
    "How can we be sure that the board boundaries do not interfere with the random process on a given iteration? Imagine that you flipped a coin 9 times and ended up with 9 times heads. Another heads on the 10th coin flip would lead to the extreme case where the final score is zero (all heads). However, whether the outcome of this 10th coin flip is heads or tails is independent of the fact that the lowest possible score is zero."
